# Python-Stock-Market-Project

This is a project submitted for SRND's Code Day 2020. 

The project has multiple parts: 

A scraper that pulls the historical data from Yahoo Finance. 
Multiple tools for finding infomation about ticker symbols, which includes: common ticker symbols, an explanation of ticker symbols, and a search functionality that allows for you to find the ticker symbol based on the company name. 
The main interaction with the stocks allows for the user to input a ticker symbol, then find the maximum, minimunm, or average based on the adjsuted close for the stocks entire existence. 

Additional features planned:
  A simulator that allows you to apply various trading strategies and see how they perform. 
  A functionality that allows for you to print graphs based on the stock data. 
  Comparisons between the stocks.
  
  Huge thank you to Zeke Egherman for guiding me through my first major Pyhton project.
